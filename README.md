# Bash Scripts ðŸš€

These are bash scripts for quick automated installations I've created and wanted to share. This is a continuously updated repo as I create more scripts.

I mostly use scripts for personal projects for automation purposes. Particularly I've been using scripts for Vault, Terraform and others.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you give executable permissions to the script before running. With `build_pki_secrets_engine.sh` for example:

`chmod +x ./build_pki_secrets_engine.sh`

To run the bash script, ensure you're in the correct directory to execute the script:

`./build_pki_secrets_engine.sh`
